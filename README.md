## User Management and Permissions

RecipeBook includes a comprehensive user management system with role-based access control.

### User Roles and Permissions

The application implements a hierarchical permission system with the following roles:

1. **Administrator** 👑
   - Full access to all features
   - Can edit and delete any recipe
   - Can manage users and assign permissions
   - Can delete users
   - Includes all permissions from lower roles

2. **Bearbeiten (Edit)** ✏️
   - Can create and edit their own recipes
   - Can comment on recipes (future feature)
   - Can read all recipes
   - Includes Comment and Read permissions

3. **Kommentieren (Comment)** 💬
   - Can comment on recipes (future feature)
   - Can read all recipes
   - Includes Read permissions

4. **Lesen (Read)** 👁️
   - Can only view recipes
   - Cannot create, edit, or delete recipes

5. **Gast (Guest)** 🚶
   - Temporary access for unregistered users
   - Can only view recipes
   - No persistent account

### Permission Hierarchy

The permission system follows a hierarchical model where higher roles inherit all permissions from lower roles:

```
Administrator → Edit → Comment → Read → Guest
```

- **Edit** permission includes **Comment** and **Read**
- **Comment** permission includes **Read**
- Only **Administrators** can delete recipes
- Only **Administrators** can manage users and permissions

### Getting Started

#### First User Setup

The first user to register automatically becomes an administrator with full permissions. This ensures that there is always at least one administrator who can manage the system.

#### User Registration

New users can register through the login screen:
1. Click "Registrieren" on the login page
2. Fill in your details (first name, last name, email, password)
3. Submit the registration form
4. New users receive **Read** permissions by default

#### Guest Access

Users can also access the application as a guest:
1. Click "Als Gast anmelden" on the login page
2. Guest users can view recipes but cannot edit or create content
3. Guest sessions are temporary and not saved

### User Management (Admin Only)

Administrators can manage users through the Settings menu:

1. Navigate to Settings → Benutzerverwaltung
2. View all registered users with their current permissions
3. Assign or change user roles:
   - Click the 🔐 button next to a user
   - Select the desired permission level
   - Confirm the change
4. Reset user passwords:
   - Click the 🔑 button
   - Set a temporary password
   - User will be prompted to change it on next login
5. Delete users:
   - Click the 🗑️ button
   - Confirm deletion
   - Note: Cannot delete yourself or the last administrator

### Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed before storage (client-side for demo purposes)
- At least one administrator must always exist in the system
- Users cannot delete their own accounts
- Administrators cannot remove admin rights if they are the last admin

## 📸 OCR-Import

RecipeBook features powerful OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to digitize recipes from photos or scanned images. Simply photograph a recipe from a cookbook, magazine, or handwritten card, and the app will automatically extract the text and parse it into a structured recipe.

### Features

- **📷 Camera Capture**: Use your device camera to photograph recipes directly
- **📁 File Upload**: Upload existing recipe images (JPG, PNG)
- **✂️ Smart Cropping**: Optional image cropping to focus on the recipe text
- **🌍 Multi-language Support**: Recognizes both German and English recipes
- **✏️ Text Editing**: Review and correct OCR results before importing
- **🔄 Offline Support**: Works completely offline after initial setup (PWA mode)

### How to Use OCR Import

1. **Start OCR Scan**
   - Navigate to the recipe form
   - Click "📸 Rezept scannen" button
   - Choose between camera capture or file upload

2. **Capture or Upload Image**
   - **Camera**: Grant camera permissions and photograph your recipe
   - **File Upload**: Select a recipe image from your device

3. **Select Language**
   - Choose the language of your recipe (🇩🇪 Deutsch or 🇬🇧 English)
   - This helps improve OCR accuracy

4. **Crop Image (Optional)**
   - Use the cropping tool to select only the recipe text area
   - Skip this step to use the full image
   - Cropping improves accuracy and processing speed

5. **Review and Edit**
   - Wait for OCR processing (typically 5-15 seconds)
   - Review the recognized text in the editable text field
   - Correct any OCR errors manually
   - The parser will automatically detect sections:
     - Recipe title (first line)
     - Ingredients (Zutaten/Ingredients)
     - Preparation steps (Zubereitung/Instructions/Directions)
     - Metadata (Portionen/Servings, Kochdauer/Time)

6. **Import Recipe**
   - Click "Übernehmen" to import the parsed recipe
   - The recipe form will be pre-filled with all extracted data
   - Review and save your recipe

### Best Practices for OCR

For best results when scanning recipes:

- **Good Lighting**: Ensure the recipe is well-lit without shadows or glare
- **High Contrast**: Clear text against a light background works best
- **Focus**: Keep the camera steady and ensure text is in focus
- **Orientation**: Hold the device parallel to the recipe page
- **Full Text**: Include section headers like "Zutaten" and "Zubereitung"
- **Cropping**: Use the crop tool to exclude non-recipe content

### Supported Recipe Formats

The OCR parser recognizes these common recipe structures:

**German Format:**
```
Rezeptname

Portionen: 4
Kochdauer: 30

Zutaten

400g Zutat 1
200g Zutat 2
2 EL Zutat 3

Zubereitung

1. Schritt eins
2. Schritt zwei
3. Schritt drei
```

**English Format:**
```
